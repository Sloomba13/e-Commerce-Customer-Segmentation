# e-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation performed using K -means clustering.

This project was completed in an internship under Zidio Development. The dataset was provided by them.

The project aims to analyze customer data from an e-commerce platform to understand purchasing behavior and segment customers for targeted marketing. The dataset includes customer information such as gender, number of orders, and various product search metrics. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values and removing duplicates, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis EDA to visualize gender distribution, order patterns, and feature correlations. Feature engineering created a new metric, Total Search, to represent overall search activity. Using the KMeans algorithm and the elbow method, customers were segmented into three distinct clusters. Insights from these clusters highlighted key behavioral patterns and identified the most engaged customers. The findings support targeted marketing and personalized recommendations. Future work could incorporate additional features and alternative clustering methods for deeper insights. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Yellowbrick, and the analysis can be reproduced by running the provided Jupyter notebook.
